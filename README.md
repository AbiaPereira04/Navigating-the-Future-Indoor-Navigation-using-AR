# Navigating the Future:Indoor Navigation using AR

With the growth in architectural intricacy of indoor spaces, individuals 
encounter challenges in orienting themselves within such spaces which 
underscores the need for user-centric navigation solutions. Using this application, 
users can find their way around the grocery aisles to grab what they need, or 
locate a store within an intricate market by providing the visual guidance through 
their smartphone. 2-D Visual markers are the core components used in this 
proposed system which is fueled by augmented reality. Multiple visual markers 
are scattered within the indoor space which upon scanning relocates the user and 
assists them using arrows on their screen to their desired destination
